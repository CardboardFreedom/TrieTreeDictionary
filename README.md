# TrieTreeDictionary
A dictionary program. It stores words from a file called dictionary.txt into a trie tree. You can search if a particular word is in the trie tree. If a word is not found, it will offer suggestions close to what you were looking for if available.

The notable aspect of this code is not what it does, but in how fast it does it.
